                        <p class = "text">The main temple of the shiva is told to have a history which goes back to one thousand years. Stories tell that Sri Ramachandra had visited this place along with his younger brother Lakshman, in respect of which an offering of a large amount of rice is made to the lord during the noon pooja and it is then poured on a rock slab in front of the shiva temple for monkeys. People gather in large numbers to watch a large number of monkeys coming from all sides of the forest to feast upon the hot rice prasadam. Till today it is the custom among these monkes that the eldest and bulkies of the bunch named as “Karinja Dadda” takes the first byte of the feast and who ever breaks the rule will be punished by the boss – “The Dadda”. Stories also refer back to Dwapara where in pandavas took shelter in the caves around this place during their excite. Gadatheertha a large lake right at the pot of the cliff, assumed to be dug by Beema Senas club (gada) stands as a testimony for the story. On the cliff there is another water source created by Arjuna’s arrow, named as varaha thirtha, along with this there are two other water sources namely ungusta theertha and Janutheertha which are respected by the devotees. A holy dip in these water sources on specific days is told to cure away skin diseases. <br><BR>FESTIVALS:<BR>Soura Ugadhi ,Vrashabha Sankramana ,Simha Sankramana ,Nagara Panchami ,Ganesha Chaturthi ,Kadiru Uthsava ,Navarathri ,Mahanavami, Vijayadashami ,Deepavali ,Karthika Pooja ,Laksha Deepothsava ,Nemothsava for Kodamanitthaya Daiva ,Subhramanya Shasti.</p>

                        <p class = "text">This slope which is acclaimed for its 'Sadashiva Temple' is 1,000 feet above ocean level keeping mythological secrets dating down to the time of Pandavas. It could be journey to the enthusiasts or an undertaking for the trekkers. It makes a move of 333 strides to achieve the top. The sheets that say 'Shiva' on the sides of the railing can be an inspiration for the devotees to stick to their climb and henceforth respect their god. When devotees achieve the top, the four "Teerthakoopas" are an amazing sight as they are beautifully sculptured in the shape of a Shanka (conch), Chakra (wheel), Gadha (weapon) and Padma (lotus). The surrounding perspective from the top can keep anybody pull to the ground for quite a long time. When you stand on this mountain, you can see Sulliamale, Ballamale on the eastern side and Kadenjamale on the southern side. With national expressway on one side and Mangalore Hassan line on the other, seeing the graceful Nethravathi River makes the perspective perfect. Not long after the brilliant nightfall, the lights from the adjacent towns, for example, Pane Mangaluru, Kalladka and B C street make us feel that we are looking at the stars from paradise.<br><BR>FESTIVALS:<br>
Individuals throng this mountain at the time of 'Aati Amavasya' and 'Sona Amavasya' for Teerthasnana (Dip in the lakes). The Renovated Bramhakalasha foundation day, Shivaratri, Nagapanchami and Sri Ganesh Chaturthi are alternate celebrations celebrated with grandeur in this Temple. The last Monday of the Karthika month is thought to be an auspicious and lively day as different religious and social projects are held.</p>

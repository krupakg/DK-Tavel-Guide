<br><br>
This place is also referred as Matsya Theertha. The Mahashir (in Tulu ‘Peruvelu’) fish is found in huge numbers in the Kapila river.

The fish in the Kapila River at Shishila are believed to be sacred and Naivedyam is offered to them after offering daily pujas. It is also believed that one can get rid of all types of skin disease after worshipping at Shishileshwara temple and feeding the fish in Kapila River. Fishing is restricted in Kapila River in and around 2 kilometers from Shishileshwara temple.

The other attractions of this place are two rocks, ‘Huli Kallu’ (rock named after tiger), and ‘Dana Kallu’ (rock named after cow). It is believed that, a tiger and a cow reached the river and tiger chased the cow. To avoid violence, Shishileshwara converted tiger and cow into rocks. These rocks are also worshipped during the annual festival.<BR>

                        <p class = "text">The Most Holy Redeemer Church is a historic Roman Catholic Church situated in the locality of Belthangady. The original structure was constructed near the site of the present-day church building. It is the one of the oldest churches in Belthangady.
 This parish comes under Belthangady Varado which is a part of Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore. This first structure of the church came into existence around 1885 and the current church is the 3rd structure. The other two older structures were demolished. In 1682, when Maratha King Sambhaji invaded Goa, some Catholic families fled from Bardez in Goa, to a place called Gaddai, Athyadka and began residing there. In about 1870, Fr. Vaz constructed a chapel here. Originally a part of Agrar Church, the chapel was served from there. During the Goa-Verapoly controversy, some families seceded from Agrar Church and built a small chapel at Gaddai, a village at the foot of the rock fortress Jamalabad. As Athyadka was malaria-prone, the chapel was abandoned in 1890. Fr. Pascal Mascarenhas constructed a thatched chapel at Belthangady. It was pulled down to make way for a stable structure and a temporary church built adjoining the presbytery served for nearly 10 years.
 This was served from Taccode for some time.

 It is a stretch of about 25 km from Kottigehara of Chikmagaluru to Charmadi of Dakshina Kannada district. To relish the beauty of the Ghat, you can trek to a series of mountains that come within the Charmadi belt.  
Panoramic views of the Charmadi range and Shishila valley can be seen from the peak. It is surrounded by many more hills like Deepadakallu, Amedikallu, Ombattu Gudda and Jenukallu Gudda.
<br><br>A unique structure of the peak that looks like Ox’s shoulder or hump. You spot this just after trekking for five minutes from the temple. 

This resemblance of the structure got the name as Ettina Bhuja trek.
Trekking inside the forest is the most thrilling part of the trek. The birds calling in the background and the leaves rustling in the wind, you will notice a sudden change in the surroundings as soon as you enter the forest.
The best reward of the trek is when you reach the peak. The view of the lush green valley and the mountains is astonishing. A perfect setting for reflecting with the view of the ranges of Charmadi and Shishila valley. </p>

<BR><br>-Didupe town is 40 mins ride from Ujire town near Dharmastala. <br>-No frequent bus services, so it is always better to hire a jeep from Ujire.<br>
- If you are heading to this destination in your own vehicle, be careful as roads are not in great condition. You have to take a left turn before Mundaje village in the Kajake route for 15 Km.

-The temple is decorated with lot of Bells mainly, offered by worshippers who have special wishes.<br>- One can find lot of monkeys inside the temple.
<BR><BR>In Tulu, sowthe means 'cucumber' and adka means 'field'. Cowherds in this place were growing cucumber and they offered the same to Lord Ganapathi of this place during their worship. Hence, this place gets the name as Southadka. 
According to temple authorities, of the many sevas offered at the temple, the most popular one is the avalakki panchakajjaya seva (a delicious mixture of beaten rice, jaggery, til (sesame), coconut, honey and banana) performed on a regular basis. The laddu prasada too shouldn’t be given a miss. One word of caution though: whoever performs the avalakki panchakajjaya seva has to share a fair amount of Lord’s prasada with the many cows around.

This Temple is dedicated to an incarnation of Lord Shiva known as Lord Mahalingeshwara. On the 
western side of the temple is a pond. People believe that in ancient times, pearls were found in this 
pond. The pond has stone steps which can lead one to the water. The word Muttu in Kannada means 
pearl. This brought the name Muttur which later became Puttur

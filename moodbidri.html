                        <p class = "text">Konaje is a village in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. The place is 7km away from the city, Moodbidri in the Naravi Road. Konaje Kallu is a large granite standing stone. It is a challenge for rock climbers since it has no footholds and will be a trekkers paradise. You will sweat and cry a lot if you are not into trekking and climbing, but the beautiful scenery will bring you peace.It is also a place of worship for the believers and paradise for trekkers. It is ‘Karnika Kshethra.’ There is Kalabairava and Mahamayi Gudi near Konaje Kallu. The distance between one gigantic granite block to another is a half kilometer. From far, it looks like a monolithic rock. There is a bond between the two granite blocks, which is called ‘Boodikere,’ where one gets pure water throughout the year.

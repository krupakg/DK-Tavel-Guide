                        <p class = "text">St Aloysius College was built in 1882. The southern wing of the building formed the Chapel as a place of prayer for students. The Chapel built in 1885 by Rev Father Joseph Willy, is a replica of world renowned Sistine Chapel at Rome. The main part of this chapel is a large hall, which is called the nave. On either side of the nave are the two aisles. The raised platform is called sanctuary. Touching the wall of the sanctuary is the main alter.The paintings on the ceiling are canvases, and on the walls, are frescoes. While every painting has its own special appeal, some have a special significance. The Chapel is primarily a place of prayer where people can commune with God. The paintings which adorn it are primarily meant to help us to pray. Their artistic value can be best appreciated in an atmosphere of prayerful silence.</p>

                        <p class = "text">The temple of Manjunatheshwara on the hills of Kadri is said to be built during the 10th or 11th century. It was converted to a complete stone structure during the 14th century.

The bronze (panchlauha) idol of Lokeshwar (identified as Brahma), about 5 feet high, of the temple is called as oldest of the South Indian temples. It has an inscription dated 968 A.D. (or 1068 A.D.[1]), engraved on the pedestal. The inscription states that King Kundavarma of the Alupa Dynasty installed the Lokeshwara idol in Kadarika Vihara.[2] It mentions Mangalore as "Mangalapura". The image has three faces and six arms, and holds and hold flowers in two of the arms. The crown depicts a Dhyani Buddha. The image has an ornate prabhavali, and two attendants. It is very well preserved with enameled eyes. There exist two other undated bronze images of similar craftsmanship, one of them is identifiable as an Avalokiteshwar (called Narayana) and other as Buddha (called Vedavyasa).[3] Another stone inscription in Tulu, Kannada and Malayalam scripts of 12-13th century A.D., in temple's kitchen, states that the ruler and the local landlords contributed land for the temple. A 1730 AD text Kadli Manjunath Mahatmyam gives an account of the association with Natha Mantha.

It is believed that Parashurama who was living in Sahyadri, killed the Kshathriyas who were cruel and donated the lands to Kashyapa. He prayed to Lord Shiva for a place to live. Lord Shiva assured Parashurama that if he performed a penance at Kadali Kshethra, Lord Shiva would reincarnate as Manjunatha for the betterment of the world. As per Shiva's orders Parashurama threw his axe into the sea and created a place for his penance. Yielding to Parashurama's prayers Lord Shiva appeared to him as Manjunatha with Goddess Parvathi and stayed at Kadri for the betterment of the world. As per the orders of Manjunatha the Sapthakoti Manthras become the seven Theerthas.</p>

                        <p class = "text"> Boloor is known for the watch tower constructed in the era of the emperor Tipu Sultan such that now the area surrounding the decaying structure is its namesake. The watch tower was constructed 15 years before his death in 1784 A.D. The place was previously known as Sultan's Battery (see artillery battery).

Sultan Battery was built of black stones and constructed to obstruct war ships from entering the river which was the major route for English invasion but was then retrieved from English by Tipu Sultan. It was also used as a fort with mounting places for cannons to avoid Britishers to enter Mangalore by sea.

There is an underground storage area under the tower that was used to store gunpowder. As per historians, this underground has secret route which leads to Mysore. Unfortunately, now it is closed and locked by Indian Tourism Authorities.

It was the major dockyard and arsenal of the ruler. It was a naval station and was of great importance to the sultan as he used it to intercept enemy warships and prevent them from docking.

If one climbs to the top of the watch tower by stairs, there is a panoramic view of Arabian Sea shows a blend of natural and man-made beauty. It is now nearly deserted with a few shacks and a boating club nearby, but it is gathering popularity among tourists.</p>

                        <p class = "text">Church of Our Lady of Rosary of Mangalore (Portuguese: Igreja Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Mangalore), or Rosario Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore, dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. It was the first Roman Catholic church in the Canara region. Historically, this was the only parish church in Mangalore reserved for the high-caste Mangalorean Catholics. It is the oldest church in Karnataka.The church was desecrated and destroyed by Mysorean ruler Tipu Sultan in 1784. Reconstruction of the church later began in 1813. In 1910, the structure of the old cathedral was demolished and the present cathedral erected in its place. The church of Our Lady of Rosary is the only church in the Mangalore Diocese which has a dome crowning the spacious sanctuary. The cross on the cathedral's dome was traditionally lit every night to serve as a beacon for seafarers. The Royal stone emblem of the Portuguese King marking their landing at Mangalore lies at the entrance of the church.In 1851, the Church of Our Lady of Rosary, Mangalore, was declared a Cathedral. In 1910, Henry Buzzoni a Jesuit priest started further beautification of the Cathedral. The formal dedication was done in 1915 by Bishop Paul Perini of Mangalore (1910–28)</p>

                        <p class = "text">Adyar waterfalls are around 12 kms drive from the Mangalore city. This waterfall has no official name and the locals name it after the place it is located i.e. Adyar.

There are two roads which lead to this place. The route towards BC Road highway near Adyar and other from Neermarga (the road towards Volachil).

There are in fact two waterfalls here in Adyar, which is at a gap of 200 meters. Both these places can be easily located by the roaring sound of the waterfall. When you take a trek down to this place you will easily find some helpful locals who can guide you to locate this waterfall.

Many of the Mangaloreans are not aware of this beautiful waterfall or they may not have visited. This is one of the recommended place to visit and enjoy.</p>

We will board a houseboat and go for a day cruise in the backwaters, enjoying scenic views of palm trees, local villages, fishing boats, etc. Lunch will be cooked and served on board. Typically Kerala cuisine is served; both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options are available. We will disembark by 3 p.m. and return to Mangalore by 5:30 p.m.

On the way to Nileswaram, we will visit Ananthapura Lake Temple, which is the only temple in Kerala in the middle of a water body. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu, and the lake is home to a sacred crocodile.
